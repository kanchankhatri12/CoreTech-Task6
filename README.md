Abstract

The Student Registration and Result Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify and digitalize the process of maintaining student records and results. The project provides a secure and user-friendly interface for administrators to register students, manage their academic details, and analyze registration trends effectively. It eliminates the need for manual record-keeping by storing all data in a centralized database, ensuring accuracy, easy accessibility, and better management of student information.

The system is built using PHP and MySQL as the backend, with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js integrated to provide a modern, responsive, and visually appealing interface. The administrator can log in securely to access the dashboard, which displays quick statistics, semester-wise student distribution, and monthly registration trends through interactive charts. Additionally, the admin can view all registered students in a searchable and filterable table, upload results for individual students, and delete records when required.

This project not only enhances efficiency in managing student records but also provides meaningful data visualization for better decision-making. By combining data management, analytics, and result handling in a single platform, the system serves as a reliable solution for educational institutions to maintain transparency, improve productivity, and ensure streamlined academic administration.
